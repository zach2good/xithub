### NOTES

- The pre-compiled DLL may be flagged by your antivirus. This is a false positive, sorry! If you're unsure about the DLL, feel free to poke around in the code and to build it locally.
- Nothing bad will happen if you use this (or leave it on) while playing on private servers, the plugin will just be idle and not collect or send any information.
